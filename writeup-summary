Databricks Application Stop/Start Monitoring
Feature Description
Overview
The Databricks Application Stop/Start Monitoring capability provides a structured and automated approach to managing application runtime behavior. This feature ensures that compute resources are used efficiently while still supporting applications that require continuous operation. The framework applies a default shutdown policy with clearly defined exception mechanisms for both new and existing workloads.

1. Default Shutdown Policy
All Databricks applications are subject to a default stop action during each monitoring cycle.
This ensures that applications not explicitly designated for continuous operation do not remain running unnecessarily, supporting both cost optimization and operational hygiene.

2. Exception Mechanism for DAB‑Provisioned Applications
Applications deployed through Databricks Asset Bundles (DAB) can be exempted from the default shutdown policy.

A dedicated exception tag must be included during provisioning.

When this tag is present, the monitoring system identifies the application as requiring 24/7/365 availability.

These applications are automatically excluded from the stop workflow and remain continuously operational.

This tag‑based approach provides a standardized, auditable method for teams to request and justify continuous runtime.

3. Exception Handling for Pre‑Existing Applications
To ensure backward compatibility, applications created prior to the introduction of this feature are managed through a centralized exception JSON file.

If an application’s name appears in this file, it is automatically excluded from the stop process.

This prevents disruption to legacy workloads while teams transition to the new tagging model.
