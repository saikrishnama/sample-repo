📢 New Feature Rollout: Databricks Long-Running App Monitoring & After-Hours Auto-Shutdown

We’re excited to announce the rollout of a new feature in our Databricks app platform:
Long-Running Application Monitoring with After-Hours Automatic Shutdown.

This feature helps reduce unnecessary compute costs and improve operational efficiency by:

Continuously monitoring long-running and idle applications

Automatically shutting down unused or stuck jobs after business hours only

Providing real-time visibility into execution status and resource usage

Preventing wasted compute spend during off-hours

With this enhancement, teams can safely run workloads during business hours while the platform intelligently manages resources after hours, ensuring lower costs, higher efficiency, and reliable operations by default.
